# TEE-NODE
TEE-NODE Infra for Trusted Execution Environment
# TEE-NODE: Secure Execution Framework for Trusted Applications

TEE-NODE enables seamless deployment of secure workloads inside Intel SGX enclaves using Node.js. Designed for confidential computing environments, it offers enclave-backed data integrity, runtime attestation, and encrypted IPC with minimal overhead.

## üöÄ Key Capabilities
- Trusted Execution via Intel SGX
- Remote Attestation Workflow
- Encrypted IPC with TEE enclave bridge
- Seamless integration with Docker for containerized deployment
- RESTful API exposure for secure client-server interactions

## üß† Use Cases
- Secure AI model inference
- Encrypted communication gateways
- Fintech transaction guards
- Healthcare data processing under HIPAA and GDPR

## üì¶ Getting Started
```bash
npm install tee-node

Modify `app.js` to route your logic inside the enclave boundary.

üèõ Enterprise Ready

TEE-NODE integrates with cloud environments like Azure Confidential Compute and supports attestation policies for regulated sectors.

# TEE-NODE and the Rise of Enclave-Native Workloads

Confidential computing isn‚Äôt just a buzzword‚Äîit‚Äôs a paradigm shift. With TEE-NODE, developers can now deploy secure applications that execute in attested, tamper-proof runtimes. This enables privacy-centric AI, fintech APIs, and defense-grade middleware without sacrificing performance.

## What is a Trusted Execution Environment?

TEEs provide isolated enclaves that shield sensitive computations from host operating systems, hypervisors, and malicious insiders. Intel SGX is the foundation for TEE-NODE‚Äôs secure runtime.

## Bridging Node.js and SGX

TEE-NODE acts as a conduit between Node.js logic and the enclave‚Äôs secure boundary. Key modules include:

- **Encrypted IPC:** Secure message passing from app to enclave.
- **Remote Attestation:** Ensures the code hasn‚Äôt been tampered with.
- **REST Interface:** Enterprise-grade API access via Dockerized services.

## Real-World Applications

- **Fintech:** Confidential transaction validation in banking ecosystems.
- **Healthcare:** HIPAA/GDPR-compliant ML workloads.
- **Defense:** Hardened data workflows for secure acoustic systems like Gibberlink.

## Looking Forward

Future integrations may include:
- Neural Acoustic Encryption (NAE)
- L2 smart contract validation
- Decentralized enclave networks
